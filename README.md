Metadata Editor (module for Omeka S)
===============================

Metadata Editor is a module for Omeka S which allows bulk editing of item metadata. This module provides functionality similar to the Omeka Classic plugin Bulk Metadata Editor.


Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module](http://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/#installing-modules).

Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.

Notes
---------------

This module is adapted from the Omeka Classic plugin Bulk Metadata Editor but is not affiliated with that plugin. There are some differences in functionality, due to differences between Omeka S and Omeka Classic.

The following metadata edits are supported:
- Search and replace text (replace a search phrase with different text for all of the selected items)
- Search and replace text with PHP regular expression (no replacement happens if the regular expression is invalid)
- Prepend text to existing metadata in the selected properties 
- Append text to existing metadata in the selected properties 
- Use delimiter to separate elements into multiple properties
- Deduplicate and remove empty fields in the selected properties

Edits are only applied to the selected item sets and properties.

Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [Omeka forum] and the [module issues] page on GitHub.
